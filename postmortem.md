# Assignment 2 Postmortem

## How difficult was this assignment?
Semi difficult because I had to learn a lot of different commands.


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?
positioning, margins, border-radius, :before/:after and overflow


## Did you use any of the links provided in the homework? If so, which ones?
yes, all of them although w3schools.com helped a lot too.


## How could this assignment be improved?
a little more guidance outside of googling in the beginning. I feel like if the assignment taught you the basics then the later parts of the assignment are left for you to do alone it would work.


## Any other comments?
No.
